# Yogurt

ðŸ‘‹ Hey. This Rubygem is a GraphQL client, written using Sorbet. It lets you write GraphQL queries that are colocated with
your code, and it generates strongly-typed classes for the results using Sorbet. The general idea is that if youâ€™re using
Sorbet to help avoid errors in your code, itâ€™d be nice to extend that to data retrieved from GraphQL APIâ€™s.

This gem is still in a fairly early stage of development. It doesnâ€™t supported named fragments. And I probably got a lot
of the decisions wrong in building it. So at some point, Iâ€™ll likely revisit those decisions and make substantial changes.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'yogurt'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install yogurt

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
